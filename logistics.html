										<h2> Logistics </h2>
									</header>
									The University of British Columbia is pleased to welcome you for the Astronomy NWxSW meeting on November 3rd and 4th.<br />
									<br />
									The exact rooms for the conference and still being arranged, but for planning purposes at this time, we are providing directions to the Department of Physics and Astronomy.<br />
									<br />
									<h3> Getting to UBC </h3>
									The closest airport to UBC is <a href="http://www.yvr.ca/en/passengers">YVR</a>.<br />
									<br />
									If you are travelling by public transport, there are several options (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DiBxYRcYRy52">example</a>).  The fastest routes will typically include the Canada Line Skytrain from YVR toward Waterfront, followed by one of the following bus lines: 49, 41, or 99, all westbound.  These bus lines can be accessed by getting off the Canada line at either the Langara-49th station, Oakridge-41st avenue station, or Broadway-City Hall, respectively.  Check traffic if possible for the fastest route.  If in doubt, just take the Skytrain to the 41 westbound bus line.<br />
									<br />
									If you are driving, then you will likely want to take SW Marine to campus once you are in Vancouver.  <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Geoyi7K13PU2">Here are directions from the Peace
									Arch</a><br />
									<br />
									There are also many taxis in the city.  The fare from YVR to UBC is around $35.  Uber and Lyft are not in British Columbia.<br />
									<br />
									<h3> Finding the Physics and Astronomy Department </h3>
									The Department of Physics and Astronomy is located in the Hennings building, which is shown on the <a href="http://maps.ubc.ca/PROD/index_detail.php?show=y,n,n,n,n,y&bldg2Search=n&locat1=652&locat2=#showMapCampus">following link with the red arrow</a>.<br />
									Scroll up to see zoomed in regions on the map.  The map also shows the UBC bus exchange (orange arrow), which is where most buses will drop off passengers going to UBC, including the 99 line. Further details regarding bus lines are given below.<br />
									<br />
									If arriving by car, you will want to park at the North Parkade (red arrow) or the Health Sciences Parkade (orange arrow) on <a href="http://maps.ubc.ca/PROD/index_detail.php?show=y,n,n,n,n,y&bldg2Search=y&locat1=792&locat2=467#showMapCampus">this map</a>.<br />
									<br />
									<h3> Accommodations </h3>
									We do not have reserved accommodations, so we strongly encourage you to book a hotel room soon.  We recommend booking at the <a href="https://www.parkinn.com/vancouverca">Park Inn</a> because it is on the 99 bus line (which will take you straight to the UBC bus exchange), has easy access to downtown, and is one of the more affordable hotels in the area.  As of this time, they still have plenty of availability. Other options include the <a href="https://live.carey-edu.ca/">Carey Centre</a> on the UBC campus, or if you prefer downtown, the <a href="https://www.sunsetinn.com/">Sunset Inn and Suites</a>. There are many options with a range of pricing, so please feel free to look around and make sure to check public transit accessibility.<br />
									<br />
									Google Maps has accurate information about public transit (run by Translink) in the area, but if you prefer to search the transit site directly or require additional information, please see the <a href="https://www.translink.ca">Translink website</a>.<br />
									<br />
									<h3> Childcare </h3>
									There is an option for up to 8 children (aged 18 months to 6 years) to attend an on-campus childcare centre that is 2 minutes away from the conference site. If you think you would make use of such an option, please contact <a href="mailto:acboley@phas.ubc.ca">Aaron Boley</a> to express interest. We will also ask for interest on the registration form.<br/>
