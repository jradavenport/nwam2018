										<h2> Splinter and Workshop sessions </h2>
									</header>
                  As an experiment for this year, the AstroNWxSW 2018 SOC invites the community to propose splinter sessions or workshops for the second day (Nov 4) of the meeting. While the meeting itself will cover a broad range of topics, the goal of the splinter sessions and workshops is to take advantage of having a critical mass of astronomers to get together and achieve a focussed goal.<br />
									<br />
									In 2018, the following splinter sessions will run on Sunday afternoon.<br />
									<br />
									<h3> Planetary Science Splinter Session</h3>
									Organized by Melissa Rice (WWU), Darci Snowden (CWU), Matthew Hedman (Idaho), Jason Barnes (Idaho) <br />
									This session will bring together researchers, educators, students and other professionals with interests in planetary science to discuss our current projects and opportunities for future collaborations in the NWxSW region. Discussion topics may include: specific subfields and research programs; teaching planetary science; student research opportunities; public engagement efforts; career pathways in academia and industry; ways to foster collaborations across institutions.<br />
									<br />
									If you are interested in this splinter session, please let the organizers know via <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/LsReEkKSJ7MjdyqC3">this Google Form</a> by October 26.
									<h3> Github Workshop </h3>
									Organized by Jim Davenport<br />
									In this workshop, we will introduce Github and learn core skills necessary for an effective Github workflow. This will be a hands-on tutorial where we will work in real-time to create a simple code repository and learn how to clone a repository, make a branch, commit and push our changes, and make/merge pull requests. We will also cover useful tools such as issue tracking. This workshop is intended for those completely new to github/version control as well as those who have basic experience but want to learn some best practices.<br />

									<!--
                  <br />
                  Splinter sessions and workshops can be proposed by one person or a group of people. We anticipate having 2-3 splinters/workshops, scheduled for approximately 2-3 hours on <strong>Sunday afternoon</strong>. The focused goal of a splinter or workshop could be topical (e.g. a series of talks on a specific shared interest) or to provide a hands-on workshop for a specific skill (e.g. a tutorial on collaborative scientific software development with Github).<br />
                  <br />
                  Please submit your proposal by October 3 using this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/vMhW7meUNrMKiXlB3">Google Form</a>. If there is enough interest, the SOC will select and schedule splinter sessions, otherwise, we will continue the plenary talk format from Saturday. An example workshop session proposal is provided below.<br />
                  <br />
                  We plan to announce accepted sessions by October 10 will put splinter session information on this website as soon as possible. If planning a topical splinter session, the successful proposer(s) will be able to solicit additional abstracts and/or view contributed abstracts to invite to their session. <br />
                  <br />
                  <h3> Example splinter session proposal </h3>
									<strong>Splinter/Workshop Title</strong><br />
									What’s a Github? A collaborative scientific software development workshop<br />
									<br />

									<strong>Names of organizers/proposers</strong><br />
									Henry Ngo<br />
									<br />

									<strong>How would you describe this session to attendees?</strong><br />
									<em>(e.g. a short blurb, 200 words or less, that we can use to advertise your session if selected)</em><br />
									You probably have heard of Github, or maybe even tried to download someone’s code from their Github repository. Github can also be a very powerful tool for working on coding projects either by yourself (as version control), in small groups or even larger teams. In this workshop, we will introduce Github and learn core skills necessary for an effective Github workflow. This will be a hands-on tutorial where we will work in real-time to create a simple code repository and learn how to clone a repository, make a branch, commit and push our changes, and make/merge pull requests. We will also cover useful tools such as issue tracking. This workshop is intended for those completely new to github/version control as well as those who have basic experience but want to learn some best practices.<br />
									<br />

									<strong>Why would this be a good session for AstroNWxSW 2018?</strong><br />
									<em>(For example, if you are planning a talk session, are the topics especially timely or involve many people from participating institutions? If you're planning a workshop, then why would these skills be of interest to attendees?)</em><br />
									I am proposing this session because many astronomers have mentioned to me that they think Github is a useful tool but they haven’t learned how to use it, or they are intimidated by all its features. I think this is a wonderful collaborative tool and would love to run tutorials/workshops, but there is often not enough critical mass at any one institution. I am hoping that the large audience of NWAM, especially students, would be a great way to get a critical mass.<br />
									<br />

									<strong>What are you planning to do in the session?</strong><br />
									<em>(If you plan on having talks, please list some speakers you might invite; if you are organizing a workshop, please describe what the participants will do)</em><br />
									This is going to be a hands-on tutorial. We will begin with a very short overview of what Github is, the difference between Git and Github and then we will dive right into the workflow. Participants will need to have laptop computers as we will be creating a repository together and go through the entire workflow of downloading the code, making changes and then submitting them. No particular programming language is required as the example “code” could just be text files. I think this can be a 2 hour workshop.<br />
									<br />

									<strong>Please write any other comments to support your proposal here</strong><br />
									<em>(Optional; for example, if you have asked the community for interest, you can list how many people might attend here, or any special requirements you need to run the session)</em><br />
									A room with a projector, desks/tables and wifi access would be required (most classrooms in Hennings would fit this requirement I think). We will ask people to indicate their interest in attending this workshop ahead of time so that I can recruit enough helpers to ensure we are effective at helping participants troubleshoot.<br />-->
